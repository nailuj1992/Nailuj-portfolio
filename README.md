# Nailuj's portfolio

This project is focused in showing my portfolio in a good and pretty manner. My name is Julian Gonzalez Prieto, I am from Bogota, Colombia, and I am actually studying a Co-op diploma in Canadian College on Downtown Vancouver. 'Nailuj' term has one simple explanation: it's my name backwards.

This little project (frontend part) is developed with AngularJS version 17.1.2, and it's deployed on heroku (the URL is https://nailuj-portfolio.vercel.app/).
